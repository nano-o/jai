# NAME

jai - Jail an AI agent

# SYNOPSIS

`jai` `--init` \
`jai` [*option*]...  [*cmd* [*arg*]...] \
`jai` `-u`

# DESCRIPTION

`jai` is a super-lightweight sandbox for AI agents requiring almost no
configuration.  By default it provides casual security, so is not a
substitute for using a proper container to confine agents.  However,
it is a great alternative to using no protection at all when you are
thinking of giving an agent full control of your account and all its
files.  Compared to the latter, `jai` can reduce the blast radius
should things go wrong.

By default, if you run "`jai` *cmd* [*arg*]...", it will execute *cmd*
with the specified arguments in a lightweight jail that has full
access to the current working directory and everything below,
copy-on-write access to an overlay mount of your home directory,
private `/tmp` and `/var/tmp` directories, and read-only access to
everything else.  This is known as _casual mode_, because *cmd* can
read most sensitive files on the system.  In other words, jai prevents
*cmd* from clobbering all your files, but doesn't provide much
confidentiality.

If you don't specify *cmd*, jai will launch a jailed shell by default.

If you run `jai -mstrict` *cmd* [*arg*]...", then *cmd* will be run
with an empty home directory as an unprivileged user id, but with the
current working directory mapped to its place and fully exposed.
Though the rest of the system outside the user's home directory is
available read-only, because *cmd* is running with a different user
ID, it will not be able to read sensitive files accessible to the
user.

Strict mode does not let you grant access to NFS file systems.  If
your home directory is on NFS, you can instead use bare mode with `jai
-mbare`.  Bare mode hides your entire home directory like strict mode,
but it still runs as your user ID.  (All modes use a private PID
namespace, however, so jailed software cannot kill or ptrace processes
outside of the jail.  However, bare mode allows jailed software to
read any sensitive files you have access to outside of your home
directory.)

By default, jai will store private home directories under
`$HOME/.jai`.  However, it needs the ability to set extended
attributes which is not possible if your home directory is on NFS.
You can use the option `--storage=/some/local/directory` to store
private home directories in a different location, as long as you own
the storage directory.  Alternatively, you can set the
`JAI_CONFIG_DIR` environment variable to move your entire
configuration directory from `$HOME/.jai` to a local disk.

If you want to grant access to directories other than the current
working directory, you can specify addition directories with the `-d`
option, as in `jai -d /local/build untrusted_program`.  If you don't
want to grant access to the current working directory, use the `-D`
option.

If you use casual mode and jailed software stores configuration files
in your home directory, you will find any such changes in
`$HOME/.jai/default.changes` (or wherever you specified for
`--storage`).  If you wanted these changes in your home directory, you
can destroy the jail with `jai -u`, move the changed files back into
your home directory, then re-run `jai` with the appropriate `-d` flag
to expose whatever directory contains the changed files (e.g.,
`$HOME/.application` or `$HOME/.config/application`).

jai allows the use of multiple home directories for different jails.
To use a home directory other than the default, just give it a name
with the `-n` option and it will be created on demand.  When you
specify a home directory with `-n`, strict mode becomes the default
(unless there is no unprivileged `jai` user on your system, in which
case jai falls back to bare mode).  It is possible to have multiple
home overlays by specifying `-mcasual` with `-n`.

# CONFIGURATION

If *cmd* does not contain any slashes, configuration is taken from
`$HOME/.jai/`*cmd*`.conf`, or, if no such file exists, from
`$HOME/.jai/default.conf`.

The format of configuration files is a series of lines of the form
"*option* [*value*]".  *option* can be any long command-line option
without the leading `--`, for example:

    conf .defaults
    mode casual
    dir /local/build
    mask Mail

If you want to set an option that requires an argument to the empty
string, use an `=` sign, as in `storage=`.

Within a configuration file, `conf` acts like an include directive,
logically replacing the `conf` line with the contents of another
configuration file.  (Relative paths are relative to `$HOME/.jai/`.)
jai creates a file `.defaults` with a sensible set of defaults you
should probably include directly or indirectly in any configuration
file.

jai executes jailed programs with bash.  The `command` directive
allows you to reconfigure the environment or add command-line options
to certain commands.  For instance, to use a python virtual
environment in a jail, you might create a file `python.conf` with the
following:

    conf default.conf
    mode strict
    dir venv
    name python
    command source $HOME/venv/bin/activate; "$0" "$@"

If you run `jai python`, this configuration file will load a virtual
environment before running the command.

# EXAMPLES

To install claude code in a jail called `claude`:

    curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | \
        jai -D -mstrict -n claude bash

To invoke claude code in that same jail, if $HOME/.local/bin is not
already on your path:

    PATH=$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH jai -n claude claude

To make `jai claude` use the claude jail by default:

    cat <<<EOF >$HOME/.jai/claude.conf
    conf .defaults
    name claude

    # Mode already defaults to strict; change to bare if using NFS
    mode strict

    command PATH=$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH "$0" "$@"
    EOF

Suppose you want to make your X11 session available in the claude jail
to facilitate pasting images into claude.  This significantly reduces
security, so isn't necessarily a good idea, but you can do it by
extracting your authentication cookies in your current working
directory and merging them into your claude jail.

    # Extract cookies outside jail, merge them inside jail
    xauth extract - $DISPLAY | jai -C claude xauth merge -
    # Copy a screen region you should be able to paste in claude
    import png:- | xclip -selection clipboard -t image/png

A safer way to do this is to write your screengrabs directly into the
sandbox's /tmp directory as in:

    import /run/jai/$USER/tmp/claude/scrn.png

Then in claude, just incorporate the image with `@/tmp/scrn.png`.

To use an existing codex or opencode installation in casual mode (less
safe) and have it update configuration files in your real home
directory:

    jai -d ~/.codex codex

    jai -d ~/.config/opencode -d ~/.local/share/opencode opencode

To do this by default when invoking `jai codex` (similar for `jai
opencode`):

    cat <<EOF >$HOME/.jai
    conf .defaults
    mode casual

    # no need to specify name, will be "default" by default
    # name default

    # list additional directories to expose
    dir .codex
    EOF

# OPTIONS

`--init`
: Create default configuration files and exit.  You should run this
  first, before activating any jails.

`-C` *file*, `--conf `*file*
: Specifies the configuration file to read.  If *file* does not
  contain a `/`, the file is relative to `$HOME/.jai`.  Also, if
  *file* resides in `$HOME/.jai` and does not contain a `/`, you can
  omit any `.conf` extension.  So `-C default` is equivalent to `-C
  default.conf` (assuming you don't have a file `default` in addition
  to `default.conf`).

  If no configuration file is specified, the default is based on the
  *cmd* argument.  If *cmd* contains no slashes and does not start
  with `.`, the system will use `$HOME/.jai/`*cmd*`.conf` if such a
  file exists.  Otherwise it uses `$HOME/.jai/default.conf`.

  Note that command-line arguments are parsed both before and after
  the file specified by the `-C` or `--conf` option.  Hence,
  command-line options always take precedence over configuration
  files.  When `conf` is specified in a configuration file, however,
  the behavior is different.  The specified file is read at the exact
  point of the `conf` directive, overriding previous lines and subject
  to being reversed by subsequent lines.

`-d` *dir*, `--dir` *dir*
: Grant full access to directory *dir* and everything below in the
  jail.  You must own *dir*.  You can supply this option multiple
  times.  Note that on the command line, relative paths are relative
  to the current working directory, while in configuration files, they
  are relative to your home directory.

`-D`, `--nocwd`
: By default, `jai` grants access to the current working directory
  even if it is not specified with `-d`.  This option suppresses that
  behavior.  If you run with `-D` and no `-d` options, your entire
  home directory will be copy-on-write (in casual mode) or empty (in
  bare or strict mode) and nothing will be directly exported.

`-m casual`|`bare`|`strict`, `--mode casual`|`bare`|`strict`
: Set jai's execution mode.  In casual mode, the user's home directory
  is made available as an overlay mount.  Casual mode protects against
  destruction of files outside of granted directories, but does not
  protect confidentiality:  jailed code can read most files accessible
  to the user.  You can hide specific files with the `--mask` option
  or by deleting them under `/run/jai/$USER/*.home`, but because
  casual mode makes everything readable by default, it cannot protect
  all sensitive files.

    In strict mode, the user's home directory is replaced by an empty
  directory (`$HOME/.jai/`*name*`.home`), and jailed code runs with a
  different user id, `jai`.  Id-mapped mounts are used to map `jai` to
  the invoking user in granted directories.  Strict mode is the
  default when you name a jail (see `--name`), but not for the default
  jail.

    Bare mode uses an empty directory like strict mode, but runs with
  the invoking user's credentials.  It is inferior to strict mode, but
  can be used for NFS-mounted home directories since NFS does not
  support id-mapped mounts.

`-n` *name*, `--name` *name*
: jai allows you to have multiple jailed home directories, which may
  be useful when jailing multiple tools that should not have access to
  each other's API keys.  This option specifies which home directory
  to use.  If no such jail exists yet, it will be created on demand.
  When not specified, the default is just `default`.  Note that each
  name can be associated with both a casual home directory (accessible
  at `/run/jai/$USER/`*name*`.home`, with changes in
  `$HOME/.jai/`*name*`.changes`) and a strict/bare home directory (in
  `$HOME/.jai/`*name*`.home`).  There is no special relation between
  these home directories, but casual and strict jails by the same name
  do share the same `/tmp` directory.

`--mask` *file*
: When creating an overlay home directory, create a "whiteout" file to
  hide *file* in the jail.  *file* must be a relative path and is
  relative to your home directory.  You can specify this option
  multiple times.  An easier way to hide files is just to delete them
  from `/run/jai/$USER/*.home`; hence, this option is mostly useful in
  configuration files to specify a set of files to delete by default.
  If you add `mask` directives to your configuration file, you will
  need to clear mounts with `jai -u` before the changes take effect.

`--unmask` *file*
: Reverse the effects of a previous `--mask` option.  This does not
  unmask files that have already been masked in an existing jail.  For
  that, you need to go into `$HOME/.jai/`*name*`.changes` and manually
  remove the whiteout files.  It also does nothing if you have masked
  a parent directory of *file*.  The main utility of this option is to
  reverse `mask` lines in a configuration file.  For instance, you can
  include a default set of masked files with a `conf` option and then
  surgically remove individual masked files that you want to expose.

`--unsetenv` *var*
: Filters *var* from the environment of the jailed program.  Can be
  the name of an environment variable, or can use the wildcard `*` as
  in `*_PID`.  (Since jailed processes don't see outside processes,
  you might as well filter any PIDs exposed in environment variables
  to avoid confusion.)

`--setenv` *var*, `--setenv` *var*`=`*value*
: There are two forms of this command.  If the argument does not
  contain `=`, then `--setenv` reverses the effect of `--unsetenv`
  *var*.  If *var* is a pattern, it must exactly match the unset
  pattern you want to remove.  For example, `--unsetenv=*_PASSWORD
  --setenv=IPMI_PASSWORD` and `--unsetenv=IPMI_PASSWORD
  --setenv=IPMI_PASSWORD` will both pass the `IPMI_PASSWORD`
  environment variable through to the jail, while
  `--unsetenv=*_PASSWORD --setenv=IPMI_*` will not.

    If the argument contains `=`, then *var* is always treated as a
  variable, not a pattern, and it is assigned *value* in the jail.

    If *value* contains the pattern `${`*envvar*`}`, it will be
  replaced by the value of the evironment variable *envvar* at the
  time jai was invoked.  If value contains `\`, it escapes the next
  character.

`--storage` *dir*
: Specify an alternate location in which to store private home
  directories and overlays.  The default is `$JAI_CONFIG_DIR` if set,
  otherwise `$HOME/.jai`.  However, if your home directory is on NFS
  you may wish to use storage on a local file system, as NFS does not
  support the extended attributes required by overlay file systems.

    Like `--setenv`, `--storage` expands `${`*envvar*`}` patterns and
uses `\` to escape the next character.

`--command` *bash-command*
: jai launches the jailed program you specify by running "`/bin/bash
  -c` *bash-command* *cmd* *arg*...".  By default, *bash-command* just
  runs the program as `"$0" "$@"`, but in configuration files for
  particular programs, you can use *bash-command* to set environment
  variables or add additional command-line options.

`-u`
: Unmounts all overlay directories from `/run/jai` and cleans up
  overlay-related files in `$HOME/.jai/*.work` that the user might not
  be able to clean up without root.  This option also destroys the
  private `/tmp` and `/var/tmp` directories (same directory at both
  mount points), so make sure you don't need anything in there.

  Overlay mounts for casual jails are created under
  `/run/jai/$USER/*.home` and left around between invocations of jai.
  If you wish to change "upper" directories `$HOME/.jai/*.changes`,
  the changes may not take effect until the file system is unmounted
  and remounted.  For that reason, `--mask` options are only applied
  when first creating the overlay mount.  Hence, you must run `jai -u`
  before changing `--mask` options or directly editing the changes
  directory.

`--print-defaults`
: Prints the default contents for `$HOME/.jai/.defaults`.

`--version`
: Prints the version number and copyright and exit.

# ENVIRONMENT

`SUDO_USER`, `USER`
: If jai is invoked with real UID 0 and either of these environment
  variables exists, it will be taken as the user whose home directory
  should be sandboxed.  This makes it convenient to run `jai` via
  `sudo` if you don't want to install it setuid root.  If both are
  set, `SUDO_USER` takes precedence.

`JAI_CONFIG_DIR`
: Location of jai configuration files and private home directories, by
  default `$HOME/.jai`.  If your home directory is on NFS, you may
  wish to put your private home directories elsewhere in order to use
  casual mode.

`JAI_NAME`
: Set to the name of the jai instance (specified by `-n` or `--name`)
  inside the jail.

`JAI_MODE`
: Set to the mode (strict, bare, or casual) inside a jail.

# FILES

In the following paths, the location `$HOME/.jai` can be changed by
setting the `JAI_CONFIG_DIR` environment variable.

`$HOME/.jai/default.conf`, `$HOME/.jai/`*cmd*`.conf`
: Configuration file if none is specified with `-C`.  If there is a
  file for *cmd*, then *cmd*`.conf` is used.  Otherwise `default.conf`
  is used.

`$HOME/.jai/.defaults`
: Reasonable system defaults to be included in `defaults.conf` or
  *cmd*`.conf`.  This file is created automatically by jai.  The file
  has no effect if you don't include it, but you should probably begin
  all configuration files with the line `conf .defaults` to get the
  defaults.

`$HOME/.jai/default.changes`, `$HOME/.jai/`*name*`.changes`
: This "upper" directory is overlaid on your home directory and
  contains changes that have been made inside a casual jail.  Before
  directly changing this directory, tear down and recreate the
  sandboxed home directory with `jai -u`.  The non-default version is
  used when you specify `-n` *name* on the command line.  If you
  specified `--storage=`*dir*, the changes directory will be in *dir*
  instead of `$HOME/.jai`.

`$HOME/.jai/default.work`, `$HOME/.jai/`*name*`.work`
: This "work" directory is required by overlayfs, but does not contain
  anything user-accessible.  Every once in a while the overlay file
  system may create files in here that you cannot delete.  If you are
  trying to delete an overlay directory to start from scratch and
  cannot delete this directory, try running `jay -u`, which will clean
  things up.  If you specified `--storage=`*dir*, or used a symbolic
  link for your changes directory, then the work directory will always
  be next to the changes directory wherever that lives.

`$HOME/.jai/default.home`, `$HOME/.jai/`*name*`.home`
: Private home directory for bare and strict jails.  If you specified
  `--storage=`*dir*, the these directories will be under *dir* instead
  of `$HOME/.jai`.

`/run/jai/$USER/default.home`, `/run/jai/$USER/`*name*`.home`
: Home directories for casual jails.  You can delete files with
  sensitive data in these jail directories to hide theme from jailed
  processes, or see the `--mask` option.

`/run/jai/$USER/tmp/default`, `/run/jai/$USER/tmp/`*name*
: Private `/tmp` and `/var/tmp` directory (they are the same) in
  jails.

# BUGS

Overlayfs needs an empty directory `$HOME/.jai/work`, into which it
places two root-owned directories `index` and `work`.  Usually these
directories are empty when the file system is unmounted.  However,
occasionally they contain files, in which case it requires root
privileges to delete the directories.  You can run `jai -u` to clean
these up if you are unable to delete them.

Overlayfs can be flaky.  If the attributes on the `default.changes`
directory get out of sync, it may require making a new
`default.changes` directory to get around mounting errors.
